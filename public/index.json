Artificial Intelligence has always been a term which intrigues people all over the world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making.\nDefinations  It is inspired by the ways people use their brains to perceive, learn, reason out and decide the action. Various organizations have coined their own versions of defining Artificial Intelligence. Some of them are mentioned below: NITI Aayog: National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI has evolved in ways that far exceed its original conception. With incredible advances made in data collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. World Economic Forum Artificial intelligence (AI) is the software engine that drives the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its impact can already be seen in homes, businesses and political processes. In its embodied form of robots, it will soon be driving cars, stocking warehouses and caring for the young and elderly. It holds the promise of solving some of the most pressing issues facing society, but also presents challenges such as inscrutable “black box” algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. As rapid advances in machine learning (ML) increase the scope and scale of AI’s deployment across all aspects of daily life, and as the technology itself can learn and change on its own, multi-stakeholder collaboration is required to optimize accountability, transparency, privacy and impartiality to create trust\nEuropean Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision AI is not a welldefined technology and no universally agreed definition exists. It is rather a cover term for techniques associated with data analysis and pattern recognition. AI is not a new technology, having existed since the 1950s. While some markets, sectors and individual businesses are more advanced than others. AI is still at a relatively early stage of development, so that the range of potential applications, and the quality of most existing applications, have ample margins left for further development and improvement. Encyclopedia Britannica Artificial intelligence (AI), isthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize or learn, from past experience. What is Not Artificial Intelligence ? Since we have a lot of different technologies which exist around us in today’s time, it is very common for us to misunderstand any other technology as AI. That is why, we need to have a clear distinction between what is AI and what is not.\nAs we discussed earlier, any machine that has been trained with data and can make decisions/predictions on its own can be termed as AI. Here, the term ‘training’ is important.\nAutomation vs Artificial Intelligence Washing Machine A fully automatic washing machine can work on its own, but it requires human intervention to select the parameters of washing and to do the necessary preparation for it to function correctly before each wash, which makes it an example of automation, not AI. Air Conditioner An air conditioner can be turned on and off remotely with the help of internet but still needs a human touch. This is an example of Internet of Things (IoT). Also, every now and then we get to know about robots which might follow a path or maybe can avoid obstacles but need to be primed accordingly each time.  We also get to see a lot of projects which can automate our surroundings with the help of sensors. Here too, since the bot or the automation machine is not trained with any data, it does not count as AI. Also, it would be valid to say that not all the devices which are termed as \"smart\" are AI-enabled. For example, a TV does not become AI-enabled if it is a smart one, it gets the power of AI when it is able to think and process on its own. Just as humans learn how to walk and then improve this skill with the help of their experiences, an AI machine too gets trained first on the training data and then optimises itself according to its own experiences which makes AI different from any other technological device/machine. But well, surely these other technologies too can be integrated with AI to provide the users with a much better and immersive experience! Robotics and AI can definitely open the doors to humanoids and self-driving cars, AI when merged with Internet of things can give rise to cloud computing of data and remote access of AI tools, automation along with AI can help in achieving voice automated homes and so on. Such integrations can help us get the best of both worlds\n","permalink":"https://aiforkids.in/class-10/what-is-ai/","tags":null,"title":"What Artificial Intelligence and What Not Class

What exactly is Deep Learning? Let us see\nThis Flow chart will help us get the overview of Artificial Intelligence\n To read about Artificial Intelligence Go to What is AI \u0026 What Not ? and Human vs Artificial Intelligence\nNow you should be sure about what AI is, So we can jump to what is Machine learning below.\nWhat is Machine learning It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence which enables machines to improve at tasks with experience (data). The intention of Machine Learning is to enable machines to learn by themselves using the provided data and make accurate algorithms for Predictions/ Decisions. Now lets understand Machine Learning in a simple way. In literal Machine Learning is \"Machine\" + \"Learning\". It means that Associating Machines with Learning. Lets go dig it out :)\nHow Machine Learning works ?  Machines Learn in a similar manner in which humans learn. Well Lets quickly see  How Humans Learn ?  How Humans Learn ?  To understand the human learning process, let us illustrate it through a simple sequence of activities involved.  Machine Learning Process A computer learns in a similar way. However, it needs a lot of information, to ensure that it recognizes things accurately. Machines need to be trained to make decisions and to act based on goals How to Train Machines ? Computers need a lot of information to ensure accurate recognition of things\nLets Take an Example , Now think, how can a computer recognize a flame? This could be using color, size, shape, origin, temperature, etc. Once it recognizes the flame, it needs to be trained to make the decision to act, as in this case, whether it should touch the flame or not? This is based on the goals set for the computer. For example, a computer set the goal to extinguish the flame by touching or stamping. So, it will see a flame and act to touch it and extinguish it, whereas another way to avoid burning and damage is to see a flame as danger and not to touch it. Now think, how will a computer differentiate between an actual flame and a photo of the flame? A wrongly trained computer may try and extinguish the flame in the painting or touch a live flame again to get damaged. So, is it possible that they can discern based on temperature, movement, etc?\nCapability of Machines To make the machine learn, first we need to see the capability of the machine.\nCapabilities of a Machine:-  Cameras for capturing images. Receivers for capturing sound. Convertors and Speakers to produce sound. We Can provide them with sensing devices that can act like skin, eyes, ears, mouth, and noses . Some of these are called sensors.  Sensors are man-made (artificial) devices, usually made of specific materials and connected using electronic signals. They sense chemicals, waves, light, and other things and interpret them   Artificial Intelligence vs Machine learning What is Deep Learning Machine Learning vs Deep learning","permalink":"https://aiforkids.in/class-10/ai-ml-dl/","tags":null,"title":"AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Class 10"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\n","permalink":"https://aiforkids.in/class-10/foundation-concepts-quiz-class-10/","tags":null,"title":"Foundation Concepts Quiz Class 10"},{"categories":null,"contents":"\n","permalink":"https://aiforkids.in/class-10/terminologies/","tags":null,"title":"Intro AI Related Terminologies Class 10"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In the Previous Lesson we discussed about Intelligence and How AI Started?

Domains of AI refers to the main Branches of Artificial Intelligence for ex : Data, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing\nThe Flowchart below is representing the 3 domains of Artificial Intelligence\n Data Sciences ( Data ) “Data Scientist is an artist who joins all the loose ends of data together to find optimum solution for a problem and making it into Artful Intelligence.”  S. Rajeswara Sastry (Independent Researcher \u0026 Certified Data Scientist)  Data Science is all about applying mathematical and statistical principles on data. or In simple words Data Science is the study of Data, This data can be of 3 types - Audio, Visual and Textual. What is Data? How we spend most of our time in this tech era, On Internet ? The whole Internet is based on data , you search for one result on Amazon and you get so many recommendations, How ? The principle of recommendation Engine is implemented here, just for understanding we can think it like, allot of data is given to these recommendation engines and they analyze the patterns like in which category you were searching from last week and etc, and hence this will recommend you the desired products. Data is a collection of raw facts which can be processed to make Information out of it. The data can be in the form of numbers, words, symbols or even pictures for example: Data in different forms :   Numbers  10, 20, 2006, 29, 06 etc   Words Something, Learning, Thankyou  etc   Symbols  \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp;   Data Sources  DataSets DataSet is a collection of different kinds of Data.\nFor example : If someone posts something one facebook he may get Likes, Shares, Dislikes , Comments etc. All of this is Data, This collection is one Dataset There are two types of data sets :\n    Training Dataset  Used for Training the Model ( 80% of the Data ).   Testing Dataset Used for Testing the model ( 20% of the Data )    What is Information Simply Information means more details about Data arranged in some format, Information is the processed, organized and structured data Data vs Information Big Data Big Data was originally associated with 3 key Concepts - Volume, Variety and Velocity 3 Key Concepts in Big Data   Volume  Amount of Data Produced    Variety  Types of Data Produced   Velocity  Speed of Data Produced    Big Data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value. The term has been used since the 1990's with some giving credit to John Mashey. Big Data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to Capture, Curate, Manage and process Data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big Data philosophy and encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and even the structured data. However the main focus is on the unstructured data.

According to us may be someone's capability to solve maths problems faster or some one who completes the exam on time describes his/her intelligence, But what is it Actually ? Intelligence has been defined in many ways: The capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive or infer Information, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.\n How it All Started? AI or computers is not a desire for understanding the universe. It's not from wanting to further the frontiers of science and it's not even because we wanted to organize the world's Information. Computers exist because some guy let's call him John decided did he want to spend more time chilling at home rather than working hard. The fundamental urge that ries any prerson is laziness.\n We invented various forms of computing so that we can work less and spend more time relaxing. The first thing that could be considered remotely close to a computer was the abacus it is useful because it helped us calculate and keep track of the steps in our calculations. But this still required us to know the times tables and we were too lazy for that. So we built a calculator. Well there are quite a few steps in between some inventation and cration lots of things but now we are here We figured out transistors and we could use them to perform logical tasks. So we now had something that could have somewhat made our life easy.\nLook around you can you live without laptops smartphones, tabs etc ?\nBut there is problem to make machine do all that task we have to program it which is not easy. So we obviously wanted to be even lazier and that required our computers to do more. So we invented Artifical Intelligence. Have you ever thaught what if computers could do more than that if they could think like us ? What if we could get the computer to do even more of our work that we previously thought could only be done by humans like buying gifts, driving cars, flying plane completing your assignment. Okay just kidding :)\nWe're not quite there yet but what about things like identifying the unripe fruit from our farm.  What would you tell the computer what would your program look like if object color is red then keep it. What if next week it's Chili harvesting time and you only want to keep the green ones. Well I guess you'd have to rewrite your code. Wouldn't it be great if we could actually teach the computer what a tomato is ? Maybe we could refine our program if something is round red and around 100 grams. It's probably a tomato problem. but it is more subtle than that.

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or to perform a computation, created along with rules that decide which path to take when a decision is faced.\nThe rule could be: if a condition is met, the machine will do something if the condition is not met, the machine will do something else   Algorithms are a standard requirement for problem-solving and are used to solve various problems.  Simple algorithms can solve complex problems too based on logic, sequencing, repetition and writing down the conditions or rules applicable.

Data is a collection of raw facts which can be processed to make Information out of it. The data can be in the form of numbers, words, symbols or even pictures for example: Data in different forms :   Numbers  10, 20, 2006, 29, 06 etc   Words Something, Learning, Thankyou  etc   Symbols     The above data like something, learning etc. Can you understand anything from this data ? As this data is not processed into information, we can't get any information out of it. Data versus Information  Data consists of raw facts, values and figures, in itself it does not mean anything. Once it is structured, processed and presented as a response to a question it becomes Information\nDifference between Data and Information   Data Information   something other   any or   any or     Data Processing Data processing refers to organizing and performing various operations on collected data to produce meaningful information.\n Data Analysis Data analysis is about finding useful patterns in data based on the goals or purpose of the data analysis activity.  Data analysis is very important for Machine Learning Machines analyze historical and available data to make predictions and arrive at conclusions for taking action\nProcesses Involed in Data Analysis: Inspecting the Data Segregating and filtering useful data Analyzing and Making a model of the data to discover meaningful information Making Conclusion as per Goal   DataSets Artificial Intelligence requires a huge amount of data in order to provide an acceptable output. When people collectively pool their data, we can collect a huge amount of raw data. In Machine Learning, a common task is the study and construction of algorithms that can learn and make predictions on data. Such algorithms function by making data driven decisions through building a practical model from input data. Data is usually organized for the purpose of analysis in Datasets.\nDataset is a collection of related sets of Information that is composed of separate elements but can be manipulated by a computer as a unit. There are two sets of Data: 1. Training Data 2. Testing Data Training Dataset \nTesting Dataset Types of Data At the Supreme Level, Data can be divided intro two types:  1. Quantitative Data 2. Qualitative Data Quantitative Data Quantitative Data Consists   1. Numbers and things you can measure objectively    2. Dimensions such as Height, Width, and Length    3. Temperature and Humidity   4. Prices   5. Area and Volume      This is just the highest level of data. There are also different types of quantitative and qualitative data. These data can be further classified into various types as discussed in the subsequent sections.\nQuantitative Data (to be replaced) |----- Continious Data |----- Discrete Data Continious Data Discrete Data Qualitative Data Qualitative Data Consists   1.

Project Cycle is an appropriate framework which can lead us towards developing an AI Project.\n If you are developing or creating a project you need to go through some steps which are required to complete the project. For example: You want to make tea. You want to make tea. -- Making Tea  Boil Water .  Put Tea Powder\n  Put Milk  This was a simple one which was only consisting exploring the items and modelling it into tea. Lets see one more example: Creating a birthday card. Checking the factors like budget,etc Which will help us decide the next steps and understanding the Project. Acquiring data from different sources like onlin, with friends etc for Designs and ideas.  Making a list of the gathered data. Creating or Modelling a card on the basis of the data collected. Showing it to Parents or cousins to Let them check it or evaluate it.   Components of Project Cycle Components of the AI Project Cycle are:   Problem Scoping    Data Acquisition    Data Exploration    Modelling    Evaluation   Problem Scoping Problem Scoping refers to understanding a probkem finding out various factors which affect the problem, define the goal or aim of the project.\n4Ws Of Problem Scoping The 4W's of Problem Scoping are Who, What, Where and Why. These Ws helps in identifying and understanding the probem in a better and efficient manner. 1. Who - \"Who\" part helps us in comprehenting and categorizing who all are affected directly and indirectly with the problem and who are called the Stake Holders\n2. What - \"What\" part helps us in understanding and indentifying the nature of the problem and how do we get to know what helps to get us know the evidence.\n3. Where - \"Where\" does the problem arises, situation and the location.\n4. Why - \"Why\" is the given problem worth solving.\n Data Acquisition Data Acquisition is he process of collecting accurate and riliable data to work with. Data Can be in the format of text, video, images, audio and so on and it can be collected from carious sourcs like the interest, journals, newspapers and so on.\nData Exploration Data Exploration is the process of arranging the gathered data uniformaly for a better understanding. Data can be arranged in the form of a table, plotting a chart or making database. Modelling the Project Modelling is the process in which different models based on the previous components can be created and even checked for the advantages and disadvantages of the model. Evaluation Evaluation is the method of understanding the reliability of an API Evaluation and is based on the outputs which is received by the feeding the data into the model and comparing the output with the actual answers. API Stands for Application Programming Interface\n","permalink":"https://aiforkids.in/project-cycle/","tags":null,"title":"Project Cycle"},{"categories":null,"contents":" /* * ========================================================= * CARD CONTENT CSS * ========================================================= */ .classpagecontent .card { border: none !important; border-radius: 0.5rem !important; box-shadow: 0 0 40px #e6eff8 !important; margin: 0.75rem !important; padding: 0 !important; } .card { position: relative; display: -ms-flexbox; display: flex; -ms-flex-direction: column; flex-direction: column; min-width: 0; word-wrap: break-word; background-color: #fff; background-clip: border-box; border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.125); border-radius: .25rem; } .classpagecontent .card .card-header { background-color: var(--color-secondary); color: #fff !important; border-bottom: 0; } .card-header { padding: .75rem 1.25rem; margin-bottom: 0; background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.03); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.125); } .classpagecontent .card .card-body { padding: 0; } .table { width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1rem; background-color: transparent; } table { border-collapse: collapse; } .classpagecontent .card .card-body tr td { padding: 0.75rem 2rem; border-color: rgba(76, 101, 213, 0.24); } .table td, .table th { padding: .75rem; vertical-align: top; border-top: 1px solid #dee2e6; } .classpagecontent .card .card-body tr td a { color: #000; text-decoration: none !important; display: block; } .results tr[visible='false'], .no-result{ display:none; } .results tr[visible='true']{ display:table-row; } .counter{ padding:8px; color:#ccc; }   Artificial Intelligence Learning path suggests you the path for learning Artificial Intelligence efficiently.

For example: The word “hello” in binary code is: 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 – you can verify that with the binary translator and the same code with python will be print(\"hello\").\nHistory of Programming Compiler  What is meant by Compiler ? As we saw in the history of Programming that how a binary code to output hello was 01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 is tried to make easy by just using print(\"hello\"). To make this possible something should be going on between the the python code and computer to make it understand this High Level language. Here the compiler comes, In short, a compiler converts a program from a human-readable (Example: Python Code) format into a machine-readable format (Example: Binary Code). The High Level Code is called the Source Code and the basic machine code translated by the compiler is called Object Code, which the processor can \"digest\".\nA Compiler is a Computer program (Set of Instructions) that is responsible for changing programmed code (Source Code) into a more basic machine language code (Object Code) which is easy to read and understand by the computer itself.\nHow does the Compiler Work ? As to how a compiler works, that is indeed complicated. There are books and university courses on the subject. I will attempt to briefly outline the main stages of the process, but this will be a very cursory overview.\n Lexing - break up the text of the program into \"tokens\". The tokens are the \"words\" of the programming language, such as identifiers (keywords, variable names, function names, etc.) or operators (=, *, \u0026, etc.). Parsing - convert the sequence of tokens into a parse tree, which is a data structure representing various language constructs: type declarations, variable declarations, function definitions, loops, conditionals, expressions, etc. Optimization - evaluate constant expressions, optimize away unused variables or unreachable code, unroll loops if possible, etc. Compilers go through the whole code at once and then compile the whole source code code unlike Interpreter which goes line by line.\n Translate the parse tree into machine instructions (or JVM byte code). Again, I stress that this is a very brief description. Modern compilers are very smart, and, consequently, very complicated.

Lets quickly see What is meant by being biased ?\nWhat is meant by bias ? Bias means to be on one side or to favour one side, One can be bias against a decision, belief, individual or a Group For Example : 1.  “I’m vegetarian.” This shows bias against killing animals for meat. 2. I disagree that we should re-elect The leader. (political bias) 3. I hate classical music: it is too complex. (musical genre bias) Machines being Biased We know that Bias is possible when you favour one side and for that you need to think. This means that to be biased we need to have thinking ability and Machines do not have that. So How can machines be Biased ? Well, This is possible because as machines can't think but the developer can. The person who developed the machine can have his own biases. The biases of a developer can transfer into the machine through the Algorithms.\n Examples of AI Bias:   Machine Voices   What will happen after the end of jobs ?

OR Artificial Intelligence is the Intelligence of machines and it is the branch of Computer Science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behaviours. Definations by Organizations It is inspired by the ways people use their brains to perceive, learn, reason out and decide the action. Various organizations have coined their own versions of defining Artificial Intelligence. Some of them are mentioned below: Computers with the ability to mimic or duplicate human brain Toggle View  NITI Aayog: National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human intelligence, AI has evolved in ways that far exceed its original conception. With incredible advances made in data collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed to take over a variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity. World Economic Forum Artificial intelligence (AI) is the software engine that drives the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its impact can already be seen in homes, businesses and political processes. In its embodied form of robots, it will soon be driving cars, stocking warehouses and caring for the young and elderly. It holds the promise of solving some of the most pressing issues facing society, but also presents challenges such as inscrutable “black box” algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. As rapid advances in machine learning (ML) increase the scope and scale of AI’s deployment across all aspects of daily life, and as the technology itself can learn and change on its own, multi-stakeholder collaboration is required to optimize accountability, transparency, privacy and impartiality to create trust\nEuropean Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision AI is not a welldefined technology and no universally agreed definition exists. It is rather a cover term for techniques associated with data analysis and pattern recognition. AI is not a new technology, having existed since the 1950s. While some markets, sectors and individual businesses are more advanced than others. AI is still at a relatively early stage of development, so that the range of potential applications, and the quality of most existing applications, have ample margins left for further development and improvement. Encyclopedia Britannica Artificial intelligence (AI), isthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.
