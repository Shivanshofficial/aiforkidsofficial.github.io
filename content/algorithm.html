<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">Intro to Algorithms</h2>
<p>
    There is usually more than one way to solve a problem. At this stage, each way to solve
the problem is broken down into logical steps.  This is called an <span class="underline">Algorithm</span> that can
then be represented in the form of a <a href="" class="link">flowchart</a>. 
</p>

<p class="noteAlt">Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or to perform a computation, created along with rules that decide which path to take when a decision is faced.</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>The rule could be:</strong>
 <br> <br>
 <li>if a condition is met, the machine will do something</li>
 <li>if the condition is not met, the machine will do something else</li>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Algorithms</strong> are a standard requirement for <a href="/problem-solving" class="link">problem-solving</a> and are used to solve
various problems. 
</p>
<p>
    Simple algorithms can solve complex problems too based on logic,
sequencing, repetition and writing down the conditions or rules applicable.
</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Lets Consider a problem :</strong> <br> <br>
    The order in which the instructions have to be carried out will be as follows: <br>
    1. Find out the available sports teams and their entry criteria <br>
    2. Then find out the best team for you
