<p class="tip">In the <a href="/class-10/introduction-artificial-intelligence-class-10" class="link">Previous Lesson</a> we discussed about <strong>Intelligence</strong> and <strong>How AI Started?</strong> <br> <br>Topics In this Page are: <br><br> 1. Human Intelligence <br> 2. Artificial Intelligence</p>
<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">Human Intelligence</h2>

<p>Hey Welcome , What do you think about the <a href="" class="link">Intelligence</a> we Humans have ? <br> The Idea which <strong>taps</strong>  in to the mind is that we have <strong>brains</strong> and the ability to think which makes humans Intelligent?</p>

<p>According to you what is Human Intelligence? (Choose)</p>

<p>These are the Examples of Natural Human Intelligence</p>
<p class="note"><strong>How to Define Human Intelligence?</strong> <br> <br>
  1. Ability to observe,
  recognize and
  understand <br>
  2. Ability to make
  ‘smart’ decisions 
  and solve problems <br> 
  3. Ability to learn
  and increase
  knowledge

<p class="note">Any agent who can perform the above is called an <a href="" class="link">Intelligent Agent</a></p>

<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Machines or Computers are created by humans hence the intelligence in them is artificial. Machines dont have Brains like us nor they can sense, feel or express like Humans. </p>
<p class="note">Machines can be trained to do the above but there are <a href="" class="link">limitations</a>.</p>
<p >Now after Understanding this Should we term Computers as <a href="" class="link">Intelligent</a> </p>


<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">Human vs Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>To understand the difference in Human and Artificial Intelligence we need to consider some key points.</p>
<div class="note">
  <table class="content-table text-center">
    <thead><h4>Things to be considered ?</h4></thead> <br>
    <tr>
        <td> <strong>Nature</strong> </td>
        <td>Source of Intelligence</td>

  Now we know the things to be considered so we can dig them out one by one.
