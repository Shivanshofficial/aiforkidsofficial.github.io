<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1"><span class="hl-primary1">What</span> are Domains of AI ?</h2>
<p><strong>Domains of AI</strong> refers to the main Branches of Artifical Intelligence for ex : Data, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing</p>
<p class="note">The Flowchart below is representing the 3 domains of Artificial Intelligence</p>

<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">Data Sciences ( Data )</h2>
<div class="note bg-image-none p-3 "> <em class="arima-font"><strong>“Data Scientist is an artist who joins all the loose ends of data together to find optimum solution for a problem and making it into Artful Intelligence.”

    <p>
      In simple words <strong>Data Science</strong> is the study of <a href="/data" class="link">Data</a>, This data can be of
     3 types - <strong>Audio</strong>, <strong>Visual</strong> and <strong>Textual</strong>.
</p>
<h3 class="aiforkids_heading2">What is Data?</h3>
<p class="note"><strong><span class="underline">Data</span></strong> is a collection of raw facts which can be processed to make <a href="https://aiforkids.in/information" class="link">Information</a> out of it. The <strong>data</strong> can be in the form of numbers, words, symbols
  or even pictures for example: <br>
</p> 
<br>
<table class="content-table p-tag text-center">
  <thead><h4 class="aiforkids_heading4 m-0">Data in <span class="hl-primary1">different forms</span> :</h4></thead> <br>
  <tr>
      <td> Numbers </td>
      <td><strong>10, 20, 2006, 29, 06</strong> etc</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Words</td>
      <td><strong>Something, Learning, Thankyou </strong> etc</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>Symbols</td>
      <td><i class="fa fa-circle"></i> &ensp;<i class="fa fa-square">&ensp;<i class="fa fa-home"></i></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3 class="aiforkids_heading2">What is <span class="hl-primary1">Information</span></h3>

<p class="note">
  Simply Information means more details about Data arranged in some format, Information is the processed, organised and structured data

</p>

<h3 class="aiforkids_heading2">Big Data</h3>
<p class="note">Big Data was originally associated with 3 key Concepts - Volume, Variety and Velocity </p>
<div class="note">
  <table class="content-table text-center">
    <thead><h4>3 Key Concepts in Big Data</h4></thead> <br>
    <tr>
        <td> <strong>Volume</strong> </td>
        <td>Amount of Data Produced</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> <strong>Variety</strong> </td>
        <td>Types of Data Produced</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Velocity</strong></td>
        <td> Speed of Data Produced</td>
    </tr>

<p>Big Data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value. <br> <br>
The term has been used since the 1990's with some giving credit to John Mashey.
<br> <br>
Big Data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to Capture, Curate, Manage and process Data within a tolerable elapsed time.
<br> <br>
Big Data philosoply and encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and even the strucured data. However the main focus is on the unstructured data.

<p class="note">
  <strong>Computer Vision</strong> in simple words is identifying the symbols from the given object (pictures) and learn the pattern and alert or predict the future object using the camera.
