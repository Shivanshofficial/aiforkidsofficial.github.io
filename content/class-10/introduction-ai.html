<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">What is <span class="hl-primary1">Intelligence</span>?</h2>
<p>According to us may be someone's capability to solve maths problems faster or some one who completes the exam on time describes his/her intelligence, But what is it Actually ? <br>

</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Intelligence has been defined in many ways</strong>: <br> <br>
  The capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. <br> <br> More generally, it can be described as the <strong>ability to perceive or infer</strong>  <a href="/data#information" class="link">Information</a>, and to retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.</p>

<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">How it All Started?</h2>
<p>AI or computers is not a desire for understanding the universe. It's not from wanting to further the frontiers of science and it's not even because we wanted to organize the world's <a href="/data#information" class="link">Information</a>. <br> <br> Computers exist because some guy let's call him <strong>John</strong> decided did he want to spend more time chilling at home rather than <strong>working hard</strong>.
   </p><p class="note"> The fundamental urge that ries any prerson is laziness.</p>

<p class="note">We invented various forms of computing so that we can work less and spend more time relaxing. </p>
<p>The first thing that could be considered remotely close to a computer was the <a href="" class="link">abacus</a> it is useful because it helped us calculate and keep track of the steps in our calculations. <br> But this still required us to know the times tables and we were too lazy for that. So we built a <strong>calculator</strong>. <br> <br> Well there are quite a few steps in between some inventation and cration lots of things but now we are here We figured out <a href="" class="link">transistors</a> and we could use them to perform <strong>logical tasks</strong>. So we now had something that could have somewhat made our life easy.</p>
<p class="note"> Look around you can you live without laptops smartphones, tabs etc ?</p>
<p>But there is <strong>problem</strong> to make machine do all that task we have to program it which is not easy. So we obviously wanted to be even lazier and that required our computers to do more. So we invented <a href="" class="link">Artifical Intelligence</a>. <br> <br>
Have you ever thaught what if computers could do more than that if they could <strong>think like us</strong> ? What if we could get the computer to do even more of our work that we previously thought could only be done by <a href="" class="link">humans</a> like <strong>buying gifts</strong>, <strong>driving cars</strong>, <strong>flying plane</strong> completing your assignment. Okay just kidding :)</p>
<p>We're not quite there yet but what about things like identifying the unripe fruit from our farm. </p>

What if next week it's Chili harvesting time and you only want to keep the <strong>green ones</strong>. <br> <br> Well I guess you'd have to rewrite your code. Wouldn't it be great if we could actually teach the computer what a tomato is ? <br> <br> Maybe we could refine our program if something is round red and around 100 grams. It's probably a tomato problem. but it is more subtle than that.
