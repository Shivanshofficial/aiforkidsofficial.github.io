<p>As you have been progressing towards building AI readiness, you must have come across a very
  common dilemma between <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>. <br> <br> Many times, these
  terms are used interchangeably but are they the same? Is there no difference in Machine Learning
  and Artificial Intelligence? Is Deep Learning (DL) Also Artificial Intelligence? What exactly is Deep
  Learning? Let us see</p>
  <p class="note">This Flow chart will help us get the overview of Artificial Intelligence</p>
  <a href="/images/aishortFlowChart.png"><img src="/images/aishortFlowChart.png" alt="/images/aishortFlowChart.png"></a>

<p class="tip">To read about Artificial Intelligence Go to <a href="/class-10/what-artificial-intelligence-and-what-not-class-10" class="link">What is AI & What Not ?</a> and <a href="/class-10/human-intelligence-artificial-intelligence-class-10" class="link">Human vs Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Now you should be sure about what AI is, So we can jump to what is Machine learning below.</p>
<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1">What is Machine learning</h2>
<p class="note">
  It is a <strong>subset</strong> of <a href="/class-10/what-artificial-intelligence-and-what-not-class-10" class="link">Artificial Intelligence</a> which enables machines to improve at tasks with experience
<strong>(data)</strong>. <br><br> The intention of Machine Learning is to enable machines to learn by themselves using the
provided data and make accurate <a href="/algorithm" class="link">algorithms</a> for Predictions/ Decisions.
</p>
<p>Now lets understand Machine Learning in a simple way. In literal <strong>Machine Learning</strong> is "Machine" + "Learning". <br> <br> It means that Associating Machines with Learning. <em>Lets go dig it out :)</em></p>
<h2 class="aiforkids_heading2" data-toc-text="&ensp; - How ML works">How Machine Learning works ?</h2>
<p>
  
  Machines Learn in a similar manner in which humans learn. Well Lets quickly see  <strong> How Humans Learn ?</strong>
  
</p>
<h4> How Humans Learn ?</h4>
<p>  To understand the human learning process, let us illustrate it through
  a simple sequence of activities involved.
  </p>

<h4>Machine Learning Process</h4>
<p class="note">A computer learns in a similar way. However, it needs a lot of information, to ensure
  that it recognizes things accurately. Machines need to be <strong>trained</strong> to make decisions
  and to act based on goals <br> <br>How to Train Machines ? Computers need a lot of information to ensure accurate recognition of things</p>
  <p>Lets Take an Example , Now think, how can a computer recognize a flame? <br> <br>This could be using color, size, shape, origin, temperature, etc.
    Once it recognizes the flame, it needs to be trained to make the decision to act, as in
    this case, whether it should touch the flame or not? <br>
    This is based on the goals set for the computer. <br> <br>
    For example, a computer set the goal to extinguish the flame by touching or stamping.
    So, it will see a flame and act to touch it and extinguish it, whereas another way to avoid
    burning and damage is to see a flame as danger and not to touch it. <br> <br>
    Now think, how will a computer differentiate between an actual flame and a photo of
    the flame? <br> <br>A wrongly trained computer may try and extinguish the flame in the painting or touch
    a live flame again to get damaged. So, is it possible that they can discern based on
    temperature, movement, etc?</p>
    <h4>Capability of Machines</h4>
    <p>To make the machine learn, first we need to see the capability of the machine.</p>
    <div class="note">
<h4>Capabilities of a Machine:-</h4>
<br> 

<ol class="ml-0 pl-0">
  <li> Cameras for capturing images.</li>
<li>Receivers for capturing sound.</li>
<li>Convertors and Speakers to produce sound.</li>
<li>We Can provide them with sensing devices that can act like skin, eyes, ears, mouth, and noses . Some of these are called sensors.</li>
<li>
  Sensors are man-made (artificial) devices, usually made of specific materials and
  connected using electronic signals. They sense chemicals, waves, light, and other
  things and interpret them</li>
