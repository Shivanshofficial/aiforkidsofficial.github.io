    What is AI Ethics ?
</h2>
<p>An AI Code, Ethics, also Called an AI value platform, is a policy Statement that formally defines the role of artifificial intelligence as it applies to the continued deveopment of the human race.</p>
<p class="note">
     The goal of AI research should be to create not undirected intelligence but benificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>Ethics is a branch of Philosophy concerned with the grounding decisions, beliefs, policies etc. <br> <br> In some sort of framework for decising right or wrong ethics look like to resolve such questions as human morality by driving some action and belief.</p>

<p class="note">
    There are some main areas of main ethics and they can be divided into sub categories. <br> <br>
    <strong>1.</strong> Applied Ethics : Concerned with Studying what is right and just what is valuable.
    <br> 
    <strong>2.</strong> Normative Ethics : Study of how people ought ot act.

    Ethical Issues of AI
</h2>
<p>Due to the wide spread of Artificial Intelligence, all from your small Mobile phones to biggest ships and Aircrafts, AI is Dominating. <br> <br> This is the reason why everyone is worried about the ethical issues AI and Considering Class 9 Syllabus the ethical issues of Artificial Intelligence are mentioned below :</p>

   AI Bias
</h2>
<p>In this world everyone Has a bias of their own, It is the truth and no matter how people try to be unbias but actually humans have biases. </p>
<p>Lets quickly see <strong>What is meant by being biased</strong> ?</p>

<h3 class="aiforkids_heading3">What is meant by bias ?</h3>
<p class="note">Bias means to be on one side or to favour one side, One can be bias against a decision, belief, individual or a Group
</p>
<p class="noteAlt">
    <span class="underline"><strong>For Example</strong></span> : <br> <br>
    <strong>1. </strong> “I’m vegetarian.” This shows bias against killing animals for meat. <br>

    <strong>2. </strong>I disagree that we should re-elect The leader. (political bias) <br>
    
    <strong>3. </strong>I hate classical music: it is too complex. (musical genre bias)
</p>
<h3 class="aiforkids_heading3">Machines being Biased</h3>
<p>We know that Bias is possible when you favour one side and for that you need to think. This means that to be biased we need to have thinking ability and Machines do not have that. <br> <br>
So How can machines be Biased ? <br> <br>
Well, This is possible because as <strong>machines can't </strong>think but the <strong>developer can</strong>. The person who developed the machine can have his own biases. <br> <br>
</p>
<p class="note">The biases of a developer can transfer into the machine through the Algorithms.</p>

        <thead> <h4>Examples of AI Bias:</h4></thead> <br>

            <td> <strong>Machine Voices</strong> </td>
            <td> What will happen after the end of jobs ?</td>

        <tr>
            <td><strong>Google Recommendations</strong></td>
            <td>How are we going to distribute the wealth created by machines ?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Search Results</strong></td>
            <td>How do Machines affect our behaviour and interaction ?</td>
