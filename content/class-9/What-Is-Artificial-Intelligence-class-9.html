<p>Artificial Intelligence has always been a term which intrigues people all over the world.
</p>
<p class="note">Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking,
    perceiving, learning, problem solving and decision making.

    Artificial Intelligence is the Intelligence of machines and it is the branch of Computer Science that is concerned
    with the automation of intelligent behaviours.

    It is inspired by the ways people use their brains to
    perceive, learn, reason out and decide the action. <br> <br>
    Various organizations have coined their own versions of defining Artificial Intelligence. Some of them
    are mentioned below:

        AI refers to the ability of machines to perform cognitive tasks like thinking, perceiving, learning,
        problem solving and decision making. Initially conceived as a technology that could mimic human
        intelligence, AI has evolved in ways that far exceed its original conception. <br> <br>
        With incredible advances
        made in data collection, processing and computation power, intelligent systems can now be deployed
        to take over a variety of tasks, enable connectivity and enhance productivity.

        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the software engine that drives the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Its
        impact can already be seen in homes, businesses and political processes. In its embodied form of
        robots, it will soon be driving cars, stocking warehouses and caring for the young and elderly. <br> <br> It
        holds
        the promise of solving some of the most pressing issues facing society, but also presents challenges
        such as inscrutable “black box” algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. <br> <br> As
        rapid advances in machine learning (ML) increase the scope and scale of AI’s deployment across all
        aspects of daily life, and as the technology itself can learn and change on its own, multi-stakeholder
        collaboration is required to optimize accountability, transparency, privacy and impartiality to create
        trust</p>

        <br> <br>
        AI is not a welldefined technology and no universally agreed definition exists. It is rather a cover term for
        techniques
        associated with data analysis and pattern recognition. <br> <br> AI is not a new technology, having existed
        since the 1950s. While some markets, sectors and individual businesses are more advanced than others. <br> <br>
        AI is still at a relatively early stage of development, so that the range of potential applications,
        and the quality of most existing applications, have ample margins left for further development and
        improvement.

        <strong>Encyclopedia Britannica</strong>
        <br><br>

        Artificial intelligence (AI), isthe ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform
        tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of
        developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the
        ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize or learn, from past experience.
