<p class="note">
    Only the term <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> is new but the <strong>concept of AI is not new</strong>, It was started centuries ago.
    <br> <br>
    The beginnings of <a href="#" class="link">Modern AI</a> can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. <br><br> But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "<a href="#" class="link">artificial intelligence</a> " was coined.
