<h2 class="aiforkids_heading1" data-toc-text="What is Project Cycle">What is <span class="hl-primary1">Project
    Cycle</span> ? </h2>
<p>In earlier classes we have studied about <strong>Water Cycle</strong>, <strong></strong> etc. In water Cycle we
studied that how is the journey of water carried out from one step to other till the end.
</p>

<p>Like that in Project Cycle we are going to deal with the <strong>steps involved in creating a project</strong>,
starting from the given problem till the project is created and tested.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Project Cycle</strong> is a step by step <strong>process to solve</strong> the problems using
<strong>proven scientific methods</strong> and drawing the inference about it. </p>
<p>

<div class="p-tag">
Let us take some daily examples as project, requiring steps to solve the problem. <br> <br>
<h4>Making Tea</h4> <br>
<ol class="ml-0">
    <li> Boil Water .</li>
    <li> Put Tea Powder<br></li>
    <li> Put Milk</li>
</ol>

This was a simple one which was only consisting <strong>exploring</strong> the items and <strong>modelling</strong>
it into tea. Lets see one more example: <br> <br>
<h4>Creating a birthday card.</h4> <br>
<ol class="ml-0">
    <li><strong>Checking</strong> the factors like budget,etc Which will help us decide the next steps and
        understanding the Project.</li>
    <li><strong>Acquiring</strong> data from different sources like online, with friends etc for Designs and ideas.
        <br></li>
    <li>Making a list of the gathered data.</li>
    <li>Creating or <strong>Modelling</strong> a card on the basis of the data collected.</li>
    <li>Showing it to Parents or cousins to Let them check it or <strong>evaluate</strong> it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="aiforkids_heading2 " data-toc-text="Problem Scoping">Problem Scoping</h3>
<a href="/images/project-cycle-problem-scoping-class-10.png"><img class="border border-dark rounded "
        src="/images/project-cycle-problem-scoping-class-10.png" alt="Problem Scoping Project Cycle"></a>
<p class="note">Problem Scoping refers to understanding a problem finding out various factors which affect the
    problem, define the goal or aim of the project.</p>

<h3 class="anchor aiforkids_heading3">4Ws Of Problem Scoping</h3>
<p>The 4W's of Problem Scoping are Who, What, Where and Why. These Ws helps in identifying and understanding the
    problem in a better and efficient manner. </p>
<div class="note">
    <p><strong>1. Who -</strong> "Who" part helps us in comprehending and categorizing who all are affected directly
        and indirectly with the problem and who are called the <a href="#" class="link">Stake Holders</a></p>

    <p><strong>2. What -</strong> "What" part helps us in understanding and identifying the nature of the problem
        and how do we get to know what helps to get us know the evidence.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Where -</strong> "Where" does the problem arises, situation and the location.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Why -</strong> "Why" is the given problem worth solving.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="anchor aiforkids_heading3">Problem Statement Template</h3>
<p>The
    <strong>Problem Statement Template</strong> helps us to <strong>summarise</strong> all the key points into one
    single. <br> <br> Template so
    that in future, whenever there is need to look back at the basis of the problem, we can take a look at
    the Problem Statement Template and understand the key elements of it.

<h2 class="aiforkids_heading2 " data-toc-text="Data Acquisition">Data Acquisition</h3>
    <p class="note">Data Acquisition is he process of collecting accurate and reliable data to work with. <a
            href="https://aiforkids.in/data" class="link">Data</a> Can be in the format of text, video, images,
        audio and so on and it can be collected from carious source like the interest, journals, newspapers and so
        on.</p>

    <h2 class="aiforkids_heading2 " data-toc-text="Data Exploration">Data Exploration</h3>
        <p class="note">
            Data Exploration is the process of arranging the gathered data uniformly for a better understanding.
            Data can be arranged in the form of a table, plotting a chart or making database.
        </p>
        <p>If we simplify this <strong>Data Exploration</strong> means that the data which we collected in Data
            Acquisition, in Data Exploration we need to arrange it for example if we have data of 50 students in a
            class, we have their Mobile Number, Date of Birth, Class, Etc . <br> <br> In the process of data
            exploration we can make a chart for that data in which all the names will be at one place and all the
            mobile numbers at one etc.
            <br>
        </p>


        <!--      <h3 class="aiforkids_heading3" data-toc-text="Advantages"><span class="hl-primary1">Advantages </span> of Data Exploration</h3>
    <p>Here are few ways in which data exploration benefits an individual or an organization</p>
    <div class="p-tag">
        <h4 class="arima-font"><b>1.</b> Faster Action</h4>
        <p>When data is arranged in uniformly human brain can process the information faster and can get a clear understanding comparatively allot faster. </p>

        <p>
            Google chart tools are powerful, simple to use, and free. Try out our rich gallery of interactive charts
            and data tools.
        </p>
        <h4 class="arima-font"><b>2.</b> <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a></h4>
        <p>Tableau is often regarded as the grand master of data visualization software and for good reason. <br>
            <br> Tableau has a very large customer base of 57,000+ accounts across many industries due to its
            simplicity of use and ability to produce interactive visualizations far beyond those provided by general
            BI solutions. </p>
        <h4 class="arima-font"><b>3.</b> <a href="//fusioncharts.com">FusionCharts</a></h4>
        <p>
            This is a very widely-used, JavaScript-based charting and visualization package that has established
            itself as one of the leaders in the paid-for market.
        </p>
        <p>It can produce 90 different chart types and integrates with a large number of platforms and frameworks
            giving a great deal of flexibility. </p>
        <h4 class="arima-font"><b>4.</b> <a href="//highcharts.com">Highcharts</a></h4>
        <p>
            A simple options-structure allows for deep customization, and styling can be done via JavaScript or CSS.
            Highcharts is also extendable and pluggable for experts seeking advanced animations and functionality.

            <p class="note">
                <strong>Modelling</strong> is the process in which <strong>different models</strong> based on the
                <strong>visualized data</strong> can be <strong>created</strong> and even <strong>checked</strong>
                for the advantages and disadvantages of the model.
            </p>

            <p>To Make a machine learning model there are 2 ways/Approaches <strong>Learning Based Approach</strong>
                and <strong>Rule Based Approach</strong></p>
