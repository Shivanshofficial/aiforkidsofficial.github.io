<p>There are many AI applications, which are growing by the day. Some existing
    applications of AI are: 
    <br> <br>
<strong>Gaming</strong> − AI plays an important role for a machine to think of a large number of
possible positions based on deep knowledge in strategic games. For example, chess.

<br> <br>

<strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> − AI helps us interact with the computer that
understands natural language spoken by humans.

<br> <br>

<strong>Expert Systems</strong> − Machine or software that imitates the decision-making ability of
humans and uses it to provide explanations and advice to the users.

<br> <br>

<strong>Vision Systems</strong> − Systems understand, explain and describe visual
input on the computer.

<br> <br>

<strong>Speech Recognition</strong> − There are some AI-based speech recognition systems with
the ability to hear and express in sentences, and understand their meanings when a
person talks to it. For example, Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant.

<br> <br>

<strong>Handwriting Recognition</strong> − The handwriting recognition software reads the text
written on paper and recognizes the shape of the letters and converts them into
editable text.

<br> <br>

<strong>Intelligent Robots</strong> − Robots that are able to perform the instructions given by a human
