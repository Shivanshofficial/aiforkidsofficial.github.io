<p>In the earlier days programming was not as easy as it is now, at that time the codes were written in <a href="/binary" class="link">Binary</a> format. <br> <br> For example: The word <strong>“hello”</strong> in binary code is: <strong>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111</strong> – you can verify that with the binary translator and the same code with python will be <strong>print("hello")</strong>.</p>

<p>As we saw in the history of Programming that how a binary code to output hello was <strong>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111</strong> is tried to make easy by just using <strong>print("hello")</strong>. <br> <br> To make this possible something should be going on between the the python code and computer to make it understand this High Level language. 
Here the compiler comes, In short, a compiler converts a program from a human-readable (Example: Python Code) format into a machine-readable format (Example: Binary Code). <br> <br>
The <strong>High Level Code</strong> is called the <a href="/class-10/ai-terminology#source-code" class="link">Source Code</a> and the basic <strong>machine code</strong> translated by the compiler is called <a href="/class-10/ai-terminology#object-code" class="link">Object Code</a>, which the processor can "digest".</p>
<p class="note">A <strong>Compiler</strong> is a <a href="/class-10/ai-terminology#program" class="link">Computer program</a> (Set of Instructions) that is responsible for changing programmed code (Source Code) into a more basic machine language code (Object Code) which is easy to read and understand by the computer itself.</p>

<h3 class="aiforkids_heading3"  data-toc-text="How Compiler Works">How does the Compiler Work ?</h3>
<p>As to how a compiler works, that is indeed complicated. There are books and university courses on the subject. I will attempt to briefly outline the main stages of the process, but this will be a very cursory overview.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Lexing</strong> - break up the text of the program into "tokens". The tokens are the "words" of the programming language, such as identifiers (keywords, variable names, function names, etc.) or operators (=, *, &, etc.). <br> <br>
    <strong>Parsing</strong> - convert the sequence of tokens into a parse tree, which is a data structure representing various language constructs: type declarations, variable declarations, function definitions, loops, conditionals, expressions, etc. <br> <br>
    <strong>Optimization</strong> - evaluate constant expressions, optimize away unused variables or unreachable code, unroll loops if possible, etc.
</p>
<p class="tip"> <strong>Compilers</strong> go through the <strong>whole code at once</strong> and then compile the whole source code code unlike <a href="#interpreter" class="link">Interpreter</a> which goes line by line.</p>
<p>
    Translate the parse tree into machine instructions (or JVM byte code).
    Again, I stress that this is a very brief description. Modern compilers are very smart, and, consequently, very complicated.
